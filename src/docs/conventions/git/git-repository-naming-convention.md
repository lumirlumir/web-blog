Git Repository 이름 규칙과 관련된 Stack Overflow의 답변을 참고하였다. 참고한 내용은 아래와 같다.

### 1-1. First answer

> `_` is harder to type than `-`

### 1-2. Second answer

> The problem with camel case is that there are often different interpretations of words - for example, checkinService vs checkInService. Going along with Aaron's answer, it is difficult with auto-completion if you have many similarly named repos to have to constantly check if the person who created the repo you care about used a certain breakdown of the upper and lower cases. avoid upper case.

> 1. be consistent. consider usage from the various GIT vendors - how do you want your repositories to be sorted/grouped?

### 1-3. Third answer
